/*
Challenge 13

Create a function censor that accepts no arguments. censor will return a 
function that will accept either two strings, or one string. When two 
strings are given, the returned function will hold onto the two strings 
as a pair, for future use. When one string is given, the returned function 
will return the same string, except all instances of first strings (of 
saved pairs) will be replaced with their corresponding second strings 
(of those saved pairs).

To test your solution run
npm t censor
from the command line

*/

function censor() {}

module.exports = censor;
