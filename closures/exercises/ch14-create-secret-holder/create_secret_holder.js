Challenge 14

There's no such thing as private properties on a JavaScript object! 
But, maybe there are? Implement a function createSecretHolder(secret) 
which accepts any value as secret and returns an object with ONLY two 
methods. getSecret() which returns the secret setSecret() which sets 
the secret

To test your solution run
npm t create_secret_holder
from the command line

*/

function createSecretHolder(secret) {}

module.exports = createSecretHolder;
