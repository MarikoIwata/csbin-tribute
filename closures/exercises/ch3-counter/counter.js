/*
Challenge 3

Create a function counter that accepts one argument: step (number) and returns a function

When the returned function is invoked for the first time, it should return whatever 0 + step evaluates to
The second time it is invoked it should return what 0 + step + step evaluates to
The third time -> 0 + step + step + step
and so on...

To test your solution run
npm t counter
from the command line

*/

function counter(step) {}

module.exports = counter;
