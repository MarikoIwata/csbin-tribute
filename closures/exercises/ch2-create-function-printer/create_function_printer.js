/*
Challenge 2
Create a function createFunctionPrinter that accepts one input and returns a function. 
When that created function is called, it should return the input that was used when the function was created.

example: 
const printSample = createFunctionPrinter('sample');
printSample(); // => should return 'sample';

To test your solution run
npm t create_function_printer
from the command line

*/

function createFunctionPrinter(input) {}

module.exports = createFunctionPrinter;
