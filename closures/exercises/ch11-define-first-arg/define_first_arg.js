/* 
Challenge 11

Create a function defineFirstArg that accepts a function and an argument. 
Also, the function being passed in will accept at least one argument. 
defineFirstArg will return a new function that invokes the passed-in 
function with the passed-in argument as the passed-in function's first argument. 
Additional arguments needed by the passed-in function will need to be passed 
into the returned function.

To test your solution run 
npm t define_first_arg
from the command line

*/

function defineFirstArg(func, arg) {}

module.exports = defineFirstArg;
