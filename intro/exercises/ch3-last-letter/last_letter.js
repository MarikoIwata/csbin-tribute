 * Challenge 3 *

Create a function lastLetter that takes a word (string) and 
returns the last character/letter of that word.
Hint: Remember that each character/letter in a string has an 
index position that you can access with brackets: []

Bonus: check out the .at() method (it's new and useful because 
it works with negative indexes).

To test your solution run 
npm t last_letter 
from the command line

function lastLetter(word) {}

module.exports = lastLetter;
