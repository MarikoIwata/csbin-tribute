/*
Challenge 16

Create a function arrayBuilder that takes in a count object and 
returns an array filled with the appropriate numbers of elements. 
The order of the elements in the array does not matter, but repeated 
elements should be grouped.

To test your solution run
npm t array_builder
from the command line

*/

function arrayBuilder(count) {}

module.exports = arrayBuilder;
