/* 
Challenge 4

Create a function called forEach that takes an array and a callback, 
and runs the callback on each element of the array. forEach does not return anything.

To test your solution run
npm t for_each
from the command line
*/

function forEach(array, callback) {}

// see for yourself if your forEach works!
