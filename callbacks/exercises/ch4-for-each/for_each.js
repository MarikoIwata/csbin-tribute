/* 
Challenge 4

Create a function called forEach that takes up to 3 arguments
1: an array 
2: a callback function
3. thisArg (optional) â€“ the value to use as 'this' when executing callback. 
You'll run into this when getting the final test to pass (see additional note below).

forEach should call the callback on each element of the array. f
orEach does not return anything.

The last test requires you to handle all of the callback arguments that the 
real .forEach() method allows. Link to docs:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach

*/

// To test your solution run
// npm t ".*/for_each.test.js"
// from the command line

function forEach(array, callback) {}

module.exports = forEach;
