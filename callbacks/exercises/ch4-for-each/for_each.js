/* 
Challenge 4

Create a function called forEach that takes an array and a callback, 
and runs the callback on each element of the array. forEach does not return anything.

The tests require you to handle all of the callback arguments that the 
real .forEach() method allows. Link to docs:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach

*/

// To test your solution run
// npm t ".*/for_each.test.js"
// from the command line

function forEach(array, callback) {}

module.exports = forEach;
