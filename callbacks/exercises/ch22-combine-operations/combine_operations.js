/* 
Challenge 22

Create a function, combineOperations, that takes two parameters: 
a starting value and an array of functions. combineOperations should pass 
the starting value into the first function in the array. combineOperations 
should pass the value returned by the first function into the second function, 
and so on until every function in the array has been called. combineOperations 
should return the final value returned by the last function in the array. 

To test your solution run
npm t combine_operations
from the command line

*/

function combineOperations(startVal, arrOfFuncs) {}

module.exports = combineOperations;
