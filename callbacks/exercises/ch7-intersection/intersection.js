/*
Challenge 7

Create a function intersection that takes in an array of arrays, 
compares the inner arrays, and returns a new array with elements found 
in all of them. 
BONUS: Use reduce!

To test your solution run
npm t intersection
from the command line

*/

function intersection(arrays) {}

module.exports = intersection;
