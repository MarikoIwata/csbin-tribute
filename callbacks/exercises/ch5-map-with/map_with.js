/*
Challenge 5

In challenge 3, you've created a function called map. In this challenge, 
you're going to rebuild the map function by creating a function called mapWith. 
This time you're going to use forEach inside of mapWith instead of using a for loop.

To test your solution run
npm t map_with
from the command line
*/

function mapWith(array, callback) {}

module.exports = mapWith;
