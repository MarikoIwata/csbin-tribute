/*
Challenge 10

Construct a function multiMap that will accept two arrays: an array of 
values and an array of callbacks. multiMap will return an object whose 
keys match the elements in the array of values. The corresponding values 
that are assigned to the keys will be arrays consisting of outputs from 
the array of callbacks, where the input to each callback is the key.


To test your solution run
npm t multi_map
from the command line

*/

function multiMap(arrVals, arrCallbacks) {}

module.exports = multiMap;
