/* 
Challenge 14

Create a function countBy that: 
– accepts an array and a callback
– returns an object

countBy will iterate through the array
and perform the callback on each element. 

Each return value from the callback will be saved as a key on the object. 
The value associated with each key will be the number of times 
that particular return value was returned.

To test your solution run
npm t count_by
from the command line

*/
function countBy(array, callback) {}

module.exports = countBy;
