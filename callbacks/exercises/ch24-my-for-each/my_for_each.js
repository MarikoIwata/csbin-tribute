/*
Challenge 24

Write a function myForEach that accepts an array and a callback function. 
Your function should pass each element of the array (in order) into the 
callback function. The behavior of this function should mirror the 
functionality of the native .forEach() JavaScript array method as 
closely as possible. 

See the test file for detailed requirements.

To test your solution run
npm t my_for_each
from the command line

 */

function myForEach(array, callback, thisArg) {}

module.exports = myForEach;
