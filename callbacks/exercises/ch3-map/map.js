Challenge 3

Create a function called map that takes up to 3 inputs: 
1. an array 
2. a 'callback' function - a function that is applied to each element 
of the array
3. thisArg (optional) â€“ the value to use as 'this' when executing callback. 
You'll run into this when getting the final test to pass (see additional note below).

map should return a new array filled with elements that are the result 
of calling the 'callback' function on each element of the input array.

The final test requires that you handle all of the callback arguments 
that the real .map() method allows. Link to docs:
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map

*/

// To test your solution run
// npm t ".*/map.test.js"
// from the command line

function map(array, callback) {}

module.exports = map;
