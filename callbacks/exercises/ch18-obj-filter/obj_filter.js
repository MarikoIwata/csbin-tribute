/* 
Challenge 18

Create a function objFilter that accepts an object and a callback. 
objFilter should make a new object, and then iterate through the 
passed-in object, using each key as input for the callback. If the 
output from the callback is equal to the corresponding value, then 
that key-value pair is copied into the new object. objFilter will 
return this new object.

To test your solution run
npm t obj_filter
from the command line

*/

function objFilter(obj, callback) {}

module.exports = objFilter;
