/* 
Challenge 11

Construct a function objectFilter that accepts an object as the first parameter 
and a callback function as the second parameter. objectFilter will return 
a new object. The new object will contain only the properties from the input 
object such that the property's value is equal to the property's key passed 
into the callback.

Bonus: utilise Object.entries() and Object.fromEntries() in your solution

To test your solution run
npm t object_filter
from the command line
*/

function objectFilter(obj, callback) {}

module.exports = objectFilter;
