/*
Challenge 15

Create a function groupBy that:
– accepts an array and a callback
– returns an object

groupBy will iterate through the array
and perform the callback on each element.
Each return value from the callback will be saved as a key on the object.
The value associated with each key will be an array consisting of all the
elements that resulted in that return value when passed into the callback.

To test your solution run
npm t group_by
from the command line

*/

function groupBy(array, callback) {}

module.exports = groupBy;
