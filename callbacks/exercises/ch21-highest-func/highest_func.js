Challenge 21

Create a function highestFunc that accepts an object (which will contain functions) 
and a subject (which is any value). highestFunc should return the key of 
the object whose associated value (which will be a function) returns 
the largest number, when the subject is given as input.

To test your solution run
npm t highest_func
from the command line

*/

function highestFunc(objOfFuncs, subject) {}

module.exports = highestFunc;
