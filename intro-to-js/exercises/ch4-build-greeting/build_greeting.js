 * Challenge 4 *

Create a function buildGreeting that takes a time (integer) and a name (string) and print a greeting based on the following rules:
If time is between 0 (inclusive) and 11 (inclusive): "Good Morning, <name>!
If time is between 12 (inclusive) and 16 (inclusive): "Good Afternoon, <name>!
If time is between 17 (inclusive) and 23 (inclusive): "Good Evening, <name>!
If time is anything else: "That's not a real time, <name>. Maybe you need some sleep!

To test your solution run 
npm t build_greeting 
from the command line

function buildGreeting(time, name) {}

module.exports = buildGreeting;
